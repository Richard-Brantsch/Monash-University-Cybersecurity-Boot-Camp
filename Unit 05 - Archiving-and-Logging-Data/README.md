## Week 5 Homework Submission File: Archiving and Logging Data

---

### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:	

   `sudo tar xvvf TarDocs.tar` 

   or 

   `tar -xf TarDocs.tar`

   Don't need to specify directory since we are already in `~/Projects` directory.

   

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:

   `sudo tar cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude=Java  ~/Projects/TarDocs/Documents`

   

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:

   `tar -tvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java`

   You can use sudo if you want but it is not needed.

   `sudo tar -tvvf Javaless_Doc.tar | grep -i java`

**Bonus** 

- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

  `sudo tar --listed-incremental=snapshot.file -cvzf logs_backup.tar.gz /var/log`

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?

  `-x and -c can not be combined as command, you cant extract a file which has not been created.`

---

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:

   `0 6 * * */4   tar -zcf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log`

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:

    `mkdir ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}`

    

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    free -mh > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
    du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
    lsof >  ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
    df -k -BM -h | awk '{print $1,$4}' > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:  

    `chmod +x system.sh `

    

**Optional**

- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution: 

  `sudo ./system.sh`

  - `cat openlist/open_list.txt`
  - `cat freemem/free_mem.txt`
  - `cat freedisk/freedisk.txt`
  - `cat diskuse/disk_use.txt`



**Bonus**

- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory: 

  `sudo cp ~/backups/system.sh /etc/cron.weekly`

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes

1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
       /var/log/auth.log {
              missingok
              weekly
              rotate 7
              notifempty
              delaycompress
          }
    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active: 

    `sudo systemctl status auditd`

    

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below: `sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf`

    ```bash
    max_log_file = 35
    num_logs = 7
    ```
    
3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:

   -  `sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules`

   - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

```bash
-w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit
-w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit
-w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit
```


4. Command to restart `auditd`:  
   - `sudo systemctl restart auditd`

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules: 
   - `sudo auditctl -l`

6. Command to produce an audit report: 
   - `sudo aureport -au`

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications: 

   - `sudo useradd attacker`

   - `sudo aureport -m`

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`: 
   - `sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron -p war -k monitor_varcron`

9.  Command to verify `auditd` rules: 
   - `sudo auditctl -l`

---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

 1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:
    - `sudo journalctl -b -p emerg..err`
  
 2. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:
    - `sudo journalctl -b -u systemd-journald | less`
   
 3. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:

    - `sudo journalctl --vacuum-file=2`
 4. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:
    - `sudo journalctl -p 0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`
 5. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:
    - `sudo crontab -e`
    - Add the edits made to the crontab file below:
    ```bash
    @daily journalctl -p 0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
    ```
