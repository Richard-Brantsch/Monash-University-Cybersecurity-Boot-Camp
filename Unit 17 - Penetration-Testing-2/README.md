### Week 17 Homework Submission File: Penetration Testing 1

----

In this homework activity, I played the role of an independent penetration tester hired by GoodCorp Inc. to perform security tests against their CEOâ€™s workstation (DVW10).

- The CEO claims to have passwords that are long and complex and therefore not hackable.

- I am tasked with gaining access to the CEO's computer and using a Meterpreter session to search for two files that contain the strings `recipe` and `secretfile`.

- The deliverable for this engagement will be in the form of a report which you can find [here](Report_R.Brantsch.pdf)
